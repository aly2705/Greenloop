# Greenloop by Devloop

## Theme

Green tech! The N-able team responsible with the hackathon challenged us to go green and develop an innovative and impactful tech business model toghether with an app prototype that we showcased after 9 hours of coding.

## Idea and Project

Our team came up with the idea of Greenloop: an app interface that can be used to monitor user data on energy consumption, green guidelines followed, paper waste and much more, data gathered by a software installed on a bunch of devices around the monitored user.

### Greenloop for Companies

The idea was initially developed for companies to monitor their employees during work hours, each green action being rewarded with special points that can later be transformed into real bonuses.

### Greenloop Home

Extended for individual use, Greenloop Home wants to help each user track their consumption at home for a green, ecological and economical lifestyle. Following the same principle, with a software on smart devices that can track consumption, user can add custom devices and manage them.

## Usage

Our app is a prototype of some user interfaces and functionalities described above. Hence the app can be accessed via two diferrent test accounts:
